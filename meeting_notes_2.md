Ideas:
- To determine which problem we're dealing with (problem 1 or 2), we can make a super dictionary of all words from both dictionaries.  We can then use the methods from problem2 to see which dictionary contains the most words from the provided ciphertext.  Becuase the dictionaries don't overlap, this should be possible (even if random characters can cause some confusion).
